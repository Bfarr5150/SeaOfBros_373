     * When player interacts with harpoon: 
     * Adjusts player transform to transform position (probably above-middle of the harpoon)
     * Harpoon should have a small dot crosshair that appears when hovering over an object that can be grabbed
     * Harpoon aim --> need to look at logic for this
     * Attach game object to end of harpoon arrow and make a script that checks for 'interactable' tag
     * OnEnterTrigger() --> transform of chest = trasnform of harpoon arrow + an offset to make it look like it is attached to the arrow, not a part of the arrow
